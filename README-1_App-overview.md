# Deploying Fullstack Web App to AWS & integrating Dynatrace 💻
We will not be doing a local deployment of this App (on your machine).
Instead we'll go straight to Cloud (aws) deployment.
If you'd like to spin it up locally first, please make sure that you have a local instance of Postgresql server running. You can use DBeaver/PgAdmin to interact with the underlying database.
